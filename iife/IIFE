IMMEDIATELY INVOKED FUNCTION EXPRESSION (IIFE)

The code in the index, explains IIFE and also the closures
concept

WE use IIFEs to sustain the values that are executed withina a fucntion, i.e when ever a function is declared it is not invoked untill we call it. But if we want to make the function call, as soon as it is declared we use IIFE
